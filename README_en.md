## Project Introduction

Welcome to the "Classic Circuit Schematic Collection" project page! Here, we have gathered a series of classic electronic circuit design schematics aimed at providing valuable learning and reference resources for students, enthusiasts, and professional engineers. Our goal is to create a comprehensive repository that covers various types of circuit designs.

## How to Use

All schematics in this project are created in KiCad format.

**We recommend using KiCad version 8.0.4 or higher to open these files.**
